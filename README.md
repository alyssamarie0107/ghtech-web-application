# ghtech-web-application

# Project Built In:
* React
* Bootstrap 
* CSS

# Setup Instructions:
1. Download code
2. Run `npm start` in terminal 
3. Or click on link: (still need to deploy on Github Pages)

# Third Party List:
* Firebase
    * For Google Authentication
* React Router DOM
    * For Navigation

# Navigation 
* Landing
  * The "Login" button navigates to the login screen.

* Login
  * The login page will contain a simple form with an email and password inputs.
    The login button must navigate to the Contacts page.

* Contact
  * The contacts page will contain a scrollable list of usernames that a user
    has the ability to select and then send a message directly.

* Chat Room
  * The chat room screen should contain a userâ€™s message/conversation with
    another contact. If possible you should create data sets and services that
    dynamically allow you to send a message to a contact. However, it is ok to
    have hard coded content in this project.

* Why did you decide on the framework choice you used as part of your solution?
    * I chose to use React because I have experience working with it, for I was
      a React Web Development Intern last summer for a student startup called
      CliQ. I love using React because of its reusable components. Components
      remind me of lego or puzzle pieces. I like to break down a web page into
      components and build those tiny pieces first and then put them together
      last. Another reason I chose React was because it renders and makes
      updates quickly, which allows the building of a highly dynamic UI.  

* Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
    * Yes there are improvements I could make to my submission. For starters, I
      could have implemented the Firebase email/password authentication instead
      of directing the user to the Contact page when they click on the 'Submit'
      button. I could have also improved on implementing the 'Add Contacts'
      button. Currently, when a user clicks on the button, a popup modal
      appears, however, the contact does not actually add when they press 'Add'.
      In regard to the Chat Room, I could have definitely improved on making it
      such that it allows the user to dynamically send a message to a given
      contact. Lastly, I could have improved on the UI. 

* What would you do differently if you were given more time?
    * If given more time, I would have implemented everything I could have
      improved on as stated above. Unfortunately, I did not utilize all 5 days
      to work on this, for I had projects/midterms, but I did my best with the
      time I did spend on it. I also had a lot of fun doing it and will most
      likely finish this project and use it as part of my project portfolio.
